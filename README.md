# Fashion App with Flutter

- The UI desgin inspired from https://dribbble.com/shots/13968301-Fashion-App-Full-Concept.

- The login form is from a flutter package called "flutter_login". Check it out here : https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_login

- I haven't implemented the whole app, just some parts of the design as a practice for UI building. There is no logic in the source-code, just UI-related code.
